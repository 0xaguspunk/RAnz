RAnz is a .nmea GPS file processor for riders developed in java. RAnz processes .nmea GPS files and extracts statistics from that information such
as best time, best lap, distance, etc. at the same time that shows you the trace of your route. It is the best way of keeping track of your trainings and
see how much you are improving. All information will be stored in a MySQL database so do not worry about losing it!

### Uploading .nmea files to RAnz

Once you've started RAnz you will be directed to its main window where clicking on session -> load session will give you the opportunity to

After selecting your file, RAnz will ask you to click on the starting point of your session so it can have a starting point
to base all its statistics.
